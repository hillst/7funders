ok so we are just rolling with the tree and assuming the intractable states will never be reached.

So, in our simulation, we are going to get legal actions for each player.
These are:
    trash card action (+3 gold)
    build wonder action
    build pick action

the two build actions
    take the action, generate the nodes, take the terminal nodes and build 
        actions from them.
